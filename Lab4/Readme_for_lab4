In this repository I have 7 files, the description of each of the files is a s follws:

1. QuickSorth.cpp : It is C++ file which implements Quicksort taking the last element as the pivot element in the partition procedure.

2. QuickSortl.cpp : It is C++ file which implements Quicksort taking the first element as the pivot element in the partition procedure.In this actually the first element is swapped
                    with the last element in the partition procedure,thus our first element becomes the pivot for the partition procedre each time it is called.
                    
3. QuickSortm.cpp : It is C++ file which implements Quicksort taking the middle element as the pivot element in the partition procedure.In this actually the middle element is swapped
                    with the last element in the partition procedure,thus our middle element becomes the pivot for the partition procedre each time it is called.
                    
4. input.txt : A text file which on the first line contains "n" : the number of elements to be sorted and the next "n" lines conatins the numbers to be sorted.

5. outputh.txt : The file to which the output of QuickSorth.cpp is stored.

6. outputl.txt : The file to which the output of QuickSortl.cpp is stored.

7. outputm.txt : The file to which the output of QuickSortm.cpp is stored.
                    
For comparision between the various versions of QuickSort I have counted the number of swaps done in the for loop of the partition procedure.

The scripts for compiling and running the above programs are named same as the programs. So to run a program run the script with same name as program name.
