This directory contains following  files:

1. Q1.cpp :  This is a C++ program which finds maximum element in an array using recursion.
2. Q2.cpp :  This is a C++ program which sorts 5 files which are present in a folder which is passed as argument when the program is run. I have 		     passed a folder named Rfolder which contains 5 files. The sorted output is stored in files in a folder named sorted_files.The 5 input 		     files are i1.txt,i2.txt,i3.txt,i4.txt and i5.txt. The output files are named the same.



The scripts for compiling and running the above programs are named same as the programs. So to run a program run the script with same name as program name.
